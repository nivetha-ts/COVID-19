            COVID-19

        <p>
            Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
            coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.[6] The
            disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but
            often include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and losscof smell and taste. Symptoms begin one
            to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. Of those people who develop noticeable symptoms, most (81%)
            develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea,
            hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory
            failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).[8] At least a third of the people who are infected with the
            virus remain asymptomatic and do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in
            time, but they still can spread the disease.[9][10] Some people continue to experience a range of
            effects—known as long COVID—for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed.[11]
            Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease

                    during early 2020.On 10 January 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence data was shared through
                    GISAID, and by 19 March, the global
                    pharmaceutical industry announced a major commitment to address COVID-19.</p>

                    the
                    spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines;
                    travel
                    restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres.
                    Individuals
                    may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using
                    no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.[138] Many governments are now
                    mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak</p>

                exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the
                widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible

                    Masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of
                    someone
                    who may have the disease.[149] When not wearing a mask, the CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose
                    with
                    a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is
                    available.
                    Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged. Healthcare professionals interacting
                    directly
                    with people who have COVID-19 are advised to use respirators at least as protective as NIOSH-certified
                    N95
